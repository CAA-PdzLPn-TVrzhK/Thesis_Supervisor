## Build and Deployment
### Continuous Integration
Our CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions:
**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Lint**: Code quality checks (flake8, black)
2. **Test**: Run all automated tests
3. **Security**: Security vulnerability scanning
4. **Build**: Package application
5. **Deploy**: Deploy to staging/production environments
**CI Configuration:**
- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Triggers: Push to main, pull requests
- Test matrix: Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10
- Coverage reporting: Codecov integration
**Deployment Process:**
- Automatic deployment to staging on merge to main
- Manual approval required for production deployment
- Blue-green deployment strategy for zero downtime
- Rollback capability for quick recovery
