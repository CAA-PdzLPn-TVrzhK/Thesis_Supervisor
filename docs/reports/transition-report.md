## Which parts are done and which aren't done?

## Is the customer using the product?
How often, in what way? If not, why not?

## Has the customer deployed the product on their side?

## What measures need to be taken to fully transition the product?

## What are the customer’s plans for the product after its delivery?
Are they going to continue working on it? Would they like to continue
