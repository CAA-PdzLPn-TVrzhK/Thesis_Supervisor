**[Speaker 2]**  
This is for Nikita.

**[Speaker 3]**  
Can you see?

**[Speaker 1]**  
Yes, I can see.

**[Speaker 3]**  
In BookOffice I added main page with statistics of students, supervisors, requests to approve  
new students or new supervisors, and amount of groups. Here is statistics of added students  
and recent activity. There will be statistics of requests like rejected, approved, in due.  
I believe students, they are pretty the same, like similar. New students, there are 70.

**[Speaker 1]**  
So it automatically take your stuff, take this mouse, so it automatically. Yeah, that's nice.

**[Speaker 3]**  
Groups that we have for now, and amount of students in this group, and milestones, like  
progress and started, done. Settings, like I have dark light, but it's, for now it's not for all, I  
think there is all, but...

**[Speaker 1]**  
How did you implement the dark mode?

**[Speaker 3]**  
I don't remember actually, I found a template and used it. And English, Russian, but it's also  
now for the main page.

**[Speaker 1]**  
But I like this template, it's so good, it has animations.

**[Speaker 3]**  
Yeah, like template of main page or dark mode.

**[Speaker 1]**  
All of it. All of it. You see, it has some, this animation, see for example when you move.

**[Speaker 3]**  
Yeah.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Even the graph.

**[Speaker 3]**  
The graph is also a template from, maybe Ascend I think.

**[Speaker 1]**  
From Ascend?

**[Speaker 3]**  
Yeah, maybe.

**[Speaker 1]**  
So it came with these animations, right? Yeah.

**[Speaker 3]**  
Also it have week. Week. Week.  
I did nothing this week. Half year, by month. And all time, it's also a year, also by month.  
And all time it's by month, but there is only two months because it's like June and July.  
That's all. There will be links, like when you click there, you will go to the tables.  
I have not added it yet. And there is several bugs for now. I will...

**[Speaker 1]**  
But now you don't have any time because you'll be doing...

**[Speaker 3]**  
Presentation?

**[Speaker 1]**  
Presentation.

**[Speaker 3]**  
Yeah, yeah. But it's like, I can fix it in several hours.

**[Speaker 1]**  
But it's good. Click the profile picture down there.

**[Speaker 3]**  
Where?

**[Speaker 1]**  
There?

**[Speaker 3]**  
No, it's not working. It's just a picture. I don't know why it does not work for now.  
There will be like a cat, if you remember. Like this.

**[Speaker 1]**  
A cat. Yeah. So, but...  
It looks good compared to what you had previously. So this shows like you are learning  
quickly. The last one.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Okay, anything else? I can show the menu.

**[Speaker 5]**  
Your table.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Do you see anything?

**[Speaker 1]**  
Yeah, it has come.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Oh, okay. So, we restarted. We have updated our menu app.  
We'll do it. So, for now we can update our picture of your profile. Settings.  
Change profile info. You can change your first and last name and picture, for example. And  
this you need to reload the page.  
Yeah, it's changing.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Yeah, but this reminds me. You are two groups, right? Doing the same project, right?  
I've never seen this other group.

**[Speaker 5]**  
Yeah, really? Never meet? Never meet?

**[Speaker 1]**  
No, we met, but I don't remember when we met last time. Anyway, it's okay.

**[Speaker 3]**  
So, we don't know how they do their stuff.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Yeah, anyway, we will see them next week.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Also, we updated our leaderboard. Now, supervisors can give feedback for students and  
give their grades. And after this, all student's dashboard will be updated.  
But I have the student profile, so I cannot show you. Maybe Nikita, after my presentation,  
will show you the supervisor's profile. We have updated our calendar.  
Very beautiful.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Yes, it's beautiful.

**[Speaker 2]**  
And the thesis info, so this is the pop-up alert.

**[Speaker 1]**  
So, just a minute. So, thesis info, when you click it, it shows you the supervisor, thesis title.

**[Speaker 2]**  
No, this is the title. It's the example title in our base. No, no, no, no.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Here I see thesis, then thesis title. So, thesis title. So, this is supervisor's title.

**[Speaker 2]**  
It's just a text. We have the colors of the status. For example, in progress.  
Now, in progress, we can upload our draft. Let's upload for example. This one.  
Comment.

**[Speaker 1]**  
This is student, right?

**[Speaker 2]**  
Yes.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Why do they need to write comments?

**[Speaker 2]**  
Because in Moodle, we also can write a comment for our work.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Sometimes, but it's not required. Because we know you are submitting your assignment. But  
it's okay.  
So, then it should not be a must for you to write a comment. And then start with this file.  
Upload should be the first one.  
And then comment. Optional, it should be.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Also, we can check our last submission. So, this is the link for our submission.

**[Speaker 1]**  
But can you just come back? Can you come back? Close.  
Close this. So, you need to manage your steps well.

**[Speaker 2]**  
So, it gives you the current link for your file. But to see the update comment, you need to  
update the page. Maybe let's upload another one draft.

This one. Yeah, this should be optional.

**[Speaker 1]**  
This is the problem now. You see now the status is supposed to change from in progress to  
submitted. To in review.  
Not submitted, but in review. It should be in review. And not in process again.

**[Speaker 4]**  
Status is like common information about milestones. But when you open the last  
submission, there you have another status. It's status of that supervisor check your works.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Then it should not be pending. The status should be in review.

**[Speaker 4]**  
Yes, it's changed when supervisor checked.

**[Speaker 2]**  
I didn't get it. Also, when you have the new profile. When you just registered to our service.  
You have the page with the registration when you write your thesis. When you write your  
supervisor, your group. And another information which we cannot collect from the  
telegram.  
Telegram information of your account. And after this, when you click to send this  
information to back office. And in the back office, we have the alert of this notification of  
this submission of your new profile.  
And if in the back office admin approve your profile.

**[Speaker 3]**  
You have access to all functions.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Now you can see the supervisor profile.

**[Speaker 4]**  
Now I can show you the supervisor profile. You also have a profile page with information.  
With the same settings.  
You have a calendar. When you have only meetings. Without milestones.

**[Speaker 1]**  
So here it shows which meetings does it show. Your meetings or the meetings from this poll.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Meetings which supervisor create for his students.

**[Speaker 4]**  
And you can create a new meeting for example I want to choose 23rd of July. And create  
meeting. Can you go back and do it again?  
Ah, I see, I see. I am right.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Stop confusing me. So you have to update manually for it to show. You have to update it  
manually for it to show.

**[Speaker 4]**  
You need to reload.

**[Speaker 1]**  
But that's not correct. You are using react right? You are supposed to do.  
You have something that we call async. And also we have. For example.  
You are not supposed to do it now. Maybe in future. When you work on similar application.  
What you can do is. You have some data. You are sending to the database.  
And also you have. You have your UI. So you can have like an array.  
A temporary array. So which you create and then can populate the page. The user can see.  
As it fetches from your. From your API. You understand?  
So that's where you have like an array. An array that stores your data. So you have an API  
call.  
You do API call. You post in this one. When you do some update inside your application.  
You post in this one. And then it will just show automatically. So you don't need to reload  
any page.  
It will be good user experience. Compared to. You call for it to show.  
You have to call again. You have to call again. But you are using.  
React or Next.js?

**[Speaker 3]**  
React.js. Next.js. No. We use Vine.

**[Speaker 1]**  
What?

**[Speaker 3]**  
Vine.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Not Next.js. But you get the same. Yeah. The same flavor.

**[Speaker 3]**  
Maybe.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Just for someone wearing a black clothes. Another one white.

**[Speaker 4]**  
And also we have this word. Now draft. You can check students.  
It's all submission. It's all success submission. Milestones.  
Draft. With a link. And this.

**[Speaker 7]**  
I see.

**[Speaker 1]**  
But then like. That's good. What about like.  
So you are using. Google. To host.  
Or how did you do it? Using setting. To be able to.  
Run. Mini app.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Netlify. To run the Netlify. To run the mini app.  
We use Netlify. And to run our IP base. We use super base.  
When we have. Not only IP. We have the storage.  
And the database.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Because like now. Now you have. You need to have.  
HTTPS. Yeah. For you to be able to run.

**[Speaker 2]**  
We have HTTPS link.

**[Speaker 1]**  
So you got it. Free from Firebase. Or from.  
Netlify. Netlify. Netlify.

**[Speaker 2]**  
That one. Also have the cloud storage. With all.

Students that. Pictures of profile.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Another thing. Super base. By the way.  
It is automatically. Even you don't need to refresh. Your page.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Yeah. Because. Because of it.  
We have the updated link. When you. For example.  
Upload your draft. And after that. You click.  
To the. Last submission draft. You have the updated link.  
But you. Have not updated. Comment.

**[Speaker 1]**  
That's why. I think. Your front end.  
You have some issues. Because. I thought.  
You're using. Postgres. But if you're using.  
If you're using. Firebase. It's supposed.  
To just immediately. Even without reloading. To just show.  
Things. Automatically. Anyway.  
It's okay. So. You should do that research.  
Next.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Done.

**[Speaker 1]**  
So. So. How.  
When. When. When are you presenting.  
Monday.

**[Speaker 2]**  
The first group.

**[Speaker 1]**  
The first stream.

**[Speaker 2]**  
All first. First window. First stream.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Yeah. Then. You should prepare.  
You should. Come to. There.  
Since. We'll have. A little time.  
I will advise. You to create. A video.  
10. No. 10 minutes.  
One minute.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Less than two. We need. To present.  
The. Demonstration. Of our.  
Project. Less than two. Minutes.  
So. When we. Show.  
All functions.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Yeah. That's why. If you do presentation.  
The way you did here. You took more than 10 minutes. So.  
Meaning that. It will. You'll not be able to present anything else.  
Yeah. Of course. So.  
And also. Internet might. Stop working.  
Your. Device might. Not connect.  
To the projector. Take a lot of time. So.  
It is better. To come. With a video.  
You've remembered. Yeah.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Yeah. Yeah.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Oh yeah. It's. It's just a meeting.

**[Speaker 1]**  
But you should be practicing.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Presentation.

**[Speaker 6]**  
Presentation.

**[Speaker 2]**  
By maybe 10 minutes.

**[Speaker 1]**  
You will go there. You will go there. And then.  
Projector is not working. Then you. Get nervous.  
And everything. Disappear. Anyway.  
It's okay. Okay, so we are done?

**[Speaker 5]**  
Several questions for our SM. What you will do with the product after the course?

**[Speaker 6]**  
I will look at it and see what I can steal.

**[Speaker 5]**  
Will you continue the development of the product? Or contribute with our team?

**[Speaker 1]**  
So the product is already in development? And you know, right? So it's already looking like  
some good stuff that I can steal from your project.  
But anyone who maybe would like to contribute to the one that is currently open?

**[Speaker 5]**  
Okay, and how to increase the chance that it will be useful after the final delivery?

**[Speaker 1]**  
Documentation, testing. Documentation and testing. I've seen one thing that I can steal  
from you.

**[Speaker 7]**  
The calendar.

**[Speaker 1]**  
The calendar? The calendar. And the dark mode.

**[Speaker 2]**  
We have such experience in our own project. So we can work.

**[Speaker 5]**  
Next.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Show readme.

**[Speaker 2]**  
We have excellent readme, I guess. I don't know how to use it.

**[Speaker 3]**  
Here is our readme. It's okay.

**[Speaker 7]**  
It's okay?

**[Speaker 3]**  
It's just dark. Links. Demo.  
Scroll.

**[Speaker 1]**  
So what does it mean? Like I see this red. No, not red.  
Green. And then below I see brown. Not brown, but gray.

**[Speaker 3]**  
What does the gray mean? Gray is because of MD.

**[Speaker 1]**  
But it's done? Yeah, it's done. Continue.

**[Speaker 3]**  
This is to control. It's not done. It's out.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Okay. Continue.

**[Speaker 7]**  
Installation. Okay.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Also have the MIT license. The real one. The real one.

**[Speaker 7]**  
Yeah. Not a fake one.

**[Speaker 2]**  
No. I don't have.

**[Speaker 6]**  
I see. That's okay. Okay.  
Question.

**[Speaker 5]**  
Is everything clear?

**[Speaker 1]**  
Yes. It's okay. Maybe it's okay.  
Okay. What can be improved? So the only thing that can be improved is, for example,  
adding like a picture to show the image.  
Because if you just put text, if I've never seen the application, then it will be a bit hard.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Okay. We have the video of our... It's like a link.

**[Speaker 5]**  
Yeah.

**[Speaker 2]**  
The demo video and there we have the video of all our services.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Then in this case, you can just say like how to use the application. Then you can maybe see,  
you can link, you see where you put instruction, you can link, you can view the link above for  
videos and you can be able to like learn how to use it. Because, for example, if you go to App  
Store, you usually see we provide a 30-second video now on how to use it.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Also, we have the usage instruction with the instruction of...

**[Speaker 1]**  
Yeah. That's why I'm saying like you should also link to the video. Just put a link to show like  
you can easily, apart from reading, you know like a lot of people, they don't like to read.  
Of course. With such people.

**[Speaker 2]**  
Yeah.

**[Speaker 1]**  
So if they can see a video, it will be a bit easier. Okay. Question?  
That's all. That's all. Then meet you on Monday.

Yeah.

**[Speaker 2]**  
With Marco and Anton.

**[Speaker 1]**  
Yeah. I'll be there. Yeah.  
I'll be there soon.

**[Speaker 7]**  
Don't...

**[Speaker 1]**  
Thank you for making it. You're welcome. Bye.  
Bye. So hope you are going to prepare so that when you come on Monday, we just... They  
have to kill the presentation.
